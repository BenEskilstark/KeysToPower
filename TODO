  - petitions
    - How are they generated?
    - how to correlate petitions that you pass w/people's desires?
  - balance of collapse vs time to affect things
  - disposition vs traits -- how should people vary?
  - resources
    - how does parliament create legitimacy -- what is its resource?
  - how do people spend money?


- - - - - - - - TODO - - - - - - -
  - streamline how values are computed in gameReducer
  - faction InfoCard should be split into resources, finances, aggregate info
  - PetitionDialog
    - print outcomes
    - accept button
    - use legitimacy to reject
    - pass coercion threshold to reject (w/loyalty penalty -- for who?)
    - apply outcomes
    - cross-reference outcomes with desires
      - add desires to some people
      - update their loyalty

  - Simulation
    - money
      - compute taxes in one place
      - compute worker wages based on hours
      - compute clergy income based on tithe
    - loyalty
      - each resource adds 1 to overall loyalty (loyalty of each person)
      - what does each faction (per person) do when loyalty gets low
      - faction leaders expect to move up in threshold
      - switch loyalty to favorability
